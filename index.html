    <img src="images/profile.jpeg" alt="Hello, my name is Anna Paula Macedo da Rosa" width="200">
    <p>Hello! I'm Anna Paula Macedo da Rosa, 27 years old. I served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, embarking on a transformative journey in Ribeir√£o Preto from 2016 to 2017 that enriched my life with invaluable experiences and lessons.
      I have been married for 5 years. Together, we value the joy of shared experiences, especially when venturing into new cultures, immersing ourselves in new landscapes and savoring exotic cuisines. I am also captivated by video games, where my adventurous spirit finds its playground. In terms of hobbies, besides traveling and gaming, I really like watching series.</p>
